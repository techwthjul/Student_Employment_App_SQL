# 🎓 Finite U Job Search - SQL Project

Welcome to the **Finite U Job Search** project! This is a SQL-based application designed to solve a real-world problem faced by international students looking for on-campus jobs. Let's dive into what this project is all about, the technologies used, and the concepts covered!

## 📝 Introduction

When I first arrived at university as an international student, I noticed a common issue: some students ended up with multiple on-campus jobs, while others couldn't secure even one. This project aims to address that problem by prioritizing job allocations to students who don't yet have a job, ensuring a fairer distribution of opportunities.

## 🚀 Use Case

Imagine a scenario where the university's job portal gives priority to students who are still looking for their first job, rather than allowing one student to hold multiple positions. This SQL-based solution makes that possible by:

- **Preventing job hoarding:** Ensuring students with no jobs get priority.
- **Fair opportunity distribution:** Making sure everyone has a chance to get an on-campus job.
- **Simplified job matching:** Automating the matching process using SQL stored procedures and views.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **SQL Server:** The core database where all the logic is implemented.
- **PowerApps & Power Automate:** Integrated with the SQL logic to provide a user-friendly interface for students and employers.
- **GitHub:** To track and share the progress of this project.

## 📚 Concepts Covered

This project involves several advanced SQL concepts to ensure fair job distribution:

- **Views:**
  - `v_student_info`: Aggregates basic student information, including skills and ranks.
  - `v_open_position_info`: Combines open job positions with required skills and pay rates.
  - `v_fws_priority_students`: Determines Federal Work-Study (FWS) priority for students based on their earnings and awards.

- **Stored Procedures:**
  - `sp_student_info_by_id`: Matches students to jobs based on their profile, skills, and availability.
  - `sp_student_match_by_position_id`: Finds the best-suited students for a given job position, prioritizing those without current employment.
  - `p_insert_skill` & `p_remove_skill`: Manage skills in student profiles dynamically through PowerApps.

These views and stored procedures work together to automate the job matching process and ensure that the university's job allocation system is fair and efficient.
